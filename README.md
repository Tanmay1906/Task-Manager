# Task Manager

## Introduction
The Task Manager project is a comprehensive application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks and to-do lists. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and deleting tasks, along with features for setting due dates and priorities. This project aims to demonstrate the use of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to create a full-stack web application with a responsive and interactive front-end, as well as a robust and scalable back-end.
